## Cadence Withdrawal Approval POC

This sample workflow process a withdrawal request workflow with an
asynchronous activity. Simple evaluation based on
[https://github.com/samarabbas/cadence-samples](https://github.com/samarabbas/cadence-samples).

### Sample Description

- Create a new withdrawal request to start the workflow
- try to contact two separate sample auto approval systems
    - if both auto approval systems approve the request
    - if unreachable, keep retrying unless the error is disapproval
    - if either one of the approval systems rejects or is unrachable wait for user input
- the user input could take an arbitrary amount of time
    - register a callback and return activity.ErrResultPending
    - when the user approves, notify via WorkflowClient.CompleteActivity()
    - this could also be accomplished via polling
- the payment is processed if either both approval systems or a end user approves

### Steps

Setup a cadence service running, see [github.com/uber/cadence](https://github.com/uber/cadence/blob/master/README.md).

Start the dummy server:

```
dummy-server
```

Start two sample auto approval systems, both approving randomly.

```
auto-approver -p 8091
auto-approver -p 8092
```

Start the workflow and activity workers

```
withdrawal -m worker
```

Start the withdrawal workflow by creating a new entry:

```
withdrawal -m trigger
```

Go to [localhost](http://localhost:8099/list) to approve the withdrawals if
one of the two auto approvals fail. You should see the workflow complete after
you approve the withdrawal request. You can also reject it.

The system should allow for auto approvers to drop out and in as well as the
dummy server to spawn after we already triggered withdrawals.
